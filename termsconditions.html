                    <h4 class="bold_font black_text heading3">1) Account Setup / Email on file:</h4>
                    <p class="p-size2">Your account will only be set up after we have received complete payment and we
                        and/or our payment partner(s) have screened the order(s) in case of fraud. It is your
                        responsibility to provide us with an email address which you have full access to currently.
                        Please do not provide an @ the domain email address which you are using to signup with us. If
                        there is ever an abuse/billing or maintenance notification to be sent, the primary email address
                        on file will be used for this purpose. It is your responsibility to ensure the email address on
                        file is current or up to date at all times. If you register a domain with us, it is your
                        responsibility to ensure that the contact information for your domain registration account and
                        your domain name(s) is correct and up-to-date. We are not responsible for a lapsed
                        registration/renewal due to outdated contact information being associated with the domain. If
                        ever you need to change this information, you should contact our sales team via email. If you
                        provide false contact information of any kind, it may result in the termination of your account.
                        For dedicated server purchases or high-risk transactions, it will be mandatory to provide
                        government-issued identification and if needed a scan of the credit card used for the purchase.
                        On failure to meet these requirements, the order may be considered fraud and be denied.</p>
                    <p class="p-size2">Please note that we will consider your signup date as your billing date for
                        recurring payments for bank deposits or delayed payments. For example, if you have signed up on
                        the 5th day of the month and did not pay for 4 days, the billing system would still generate
                        your next invoice on the 5th of the next month even though your account would be setup only
                        after the payment has been received for the service. So we request you to make payments without
                        delay when using offline payment methods to avoid such issues.</p>
                    <p class="p-size2">Our transfers team will give their best efforts to help you move your site to us.
                        However, our transfers service is just a courtesy service, and we do not make guarantees
                        regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete the full account transfer
                        even if you opt for paid transfers. Each hosting is configured differently, and some platforms
                        save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it very difficult if not
                        impossible to migrate some or all account data. We will indeed give it our best shot, but in
                        some cases, we may be unable to assist you in a transfer of data from an old hosting account.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-size2">The free transfer services are available for one month from your sign up date.
                        Transfers outside of the initial free period will be charged; please contact a member of the
                        transfers department with specific details to receive a quote.</p>

                    <p class="p-size2">You agree to make appropriate payment for the services received from EUBoxes.com,
                        in advance of the time period during which such services are provided. You agree that until and
                        unless you notify servers of your desire to cancel any or all services received, those services
                        will be billed on a recurring basis.</p>
                    <p class="p-size2">Cancellations must be done only in writing via the cancellation form provided.
                        Once we receive your cancellation and have confirmed all necessary information with you via
                        e-mail, we will inform you in writing (typically email) that your account has been cancelled.
                        Your cancellation confirmation will contain a ticket/tracking number in the subject for your
                        reference, and for verification purposes. You should immediately receive an automatic "Your
                        request has been received..." email with a tracking number. An employee will confirm your
                        request (and process your cancellation) shortly thereafter. If you do not hear back from us or
                        do not receive the automatic confirmation email within a few minutes after submitting your
                        cancellation, please contact us immediately via phone. We require that cancellations of service
                        are done through the online form to (a) confirm your identity, (b) confirm in writing you are
                        prepared for all files/emails to be removed, and (c) document the request. This process reduces
                        the likelihood of mistakes, fraudulent/malicious requests, and ensures you are aware that the
                        files, emails, and account may be removed immediately after a cancellation request is processed.

                        that is outstanding for 5 days and not paid will result in a 10% late fee and/or an account
                        suspension until account balance has been paid in full. The 10% late fee is applied in addition
                        to whatever else is owed to servers for services rendered. Access to the account will not be

                    <p class="p-size2">Cancellations for Dedicated servers must be done 8 days prior to the invoice due
                        date. This will make sure datacenter does not charge us for the server which you intend to
                        cancel. Unfortunately, cancellations on dedicated servers which are overdue on payment cannot be
                        done as the datacenter charges for the servers on the anniversary date directly.</p>
                    <p class="p-size2">Cancellations requested after the initial 30 days for Shared and Reseller
                        accounts will go into effect on the renewal date for that particular hosting package. Unless
                        specifically requested, the account will remain active until the period expires. Any request for
                        a refund outside of the initial 30 day period will be given on a prorated basis from when the
                        refund was requested if the account is eligible for a refund. Refunds are determined by the
                        Cancellation agents at the time the account is cancelled. The following methods of payments are
                        non-refundable, and refunds will be posted as a credit to the hosting account:</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="p-size2">There are no refunds on VPS servers, dedicated servers, administrative fees,

                        reseller accounts after the initial 30 days will be refunded on a prorated basis of any unused
                        time.</p>
                    <p class="p-size2">Only first-time accounts are eligible for a refund. For example, if you've had an
                        account with us before, cancelled and signed up again, you will not be eligible for a refund or
                        if you have opened a second account with us.</p>
                    <p class="p-size2">Customers signing up for the sole purpose of getting a refund would be classified
                        as people misusing our refund policies. We have found out that people suspended on other hosts
                        for resource abuse/spam etc. signup under the Money back guarantee and try to overload our
                        servers too. This is against the TOS and as below, no refunds will be issued in such cases.
                        Also, such people just need a place to dump their data at times and just misuse the refund
                        policy for temporary hosting. We will evaluate if such misuse was done before processing any
                        refunds on all accounts. Accounts found guilty would not be entitled to a refund.</p>
                    <p class="p-size2">Violations of the Terms of Service will waive the refund policy.</p>

                    <p class="p-size2">Use 25% or more of system resources for longer then 90 seconds. There are
                        numerous activities that could cause such problems; these include: CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP,
                        etc. Run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on the server. This
                        includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD. Run any type of web spider or indexer (including
                        Google Cash / AdSpy) on shared servers. Run any software that interfaces with an IRC (Internet
                        Relay Chat) network. Run any bit torrent application, tracker, or client. You may link to legal
                        torrents off-site, but may not host or store them on our shared servers. Participate in any
                        file-sharing/peer-to-peer activities Run any gaming servers such as counter-strike, half-life,
                        battlefield1942, etc Run cron entries with intervals of less than 15 minutes. Run any MySQL
                        queries longer than 15 seconds. MySQL tables should be indexed appropriately. When using PHP
                        include functions for including a local file, include the local file rather than the URL.
                        Instead of include("http://yourdomain.com/include.php") use include("include.php") To help
                        reduce usage, do not force html to handle server-side code (like php and shtml). Only use https
                        protocol when necessary; encrypting and decrypting communications is noticeably more
                        CPU-intensive than unencrypted communications.</p>

                    <p class="p-size2">Any shared account using more than 10 gigs of disk space will be removed from our
                        off site weekly backup with the exception of Databases continuing to be backed up. All data will
                        continue to be mirrored to a secondary drive which helps protect against data loss in the event
                        of a drive failure.</p>

                    <p class="p-size2">On dedicated servers no full refund will be honored -- the 30 day money back
                        guarantee does not apply. Each of EUBoxes.com's managed shared, and reseller servers carry a 45
                        day unconditional money back guarantee on them. If you are not completely satisfied with our

                        the discretion of servers dependent upon justification provided. Third party monitoring service
                        reports may not be used for justification due to a variety of factors including the monitor's
                        network capacity/transit availability. The uptime of the server is defined as the reported
                        uptime from the operating system and the Apache Web Server which may differ from the uptime
                        reported by other individual services. To request a credit, please contact sales@EUBoxes.com
                        with justification. All requests must be made in writing via email. Uptime guarantees only apply
                        to shared / reseller solutions. Dedicated servers are covered by a network guarantee in which
                        the credit is prorated for the amount of time the server is down which is not related to our
                        uptime guarantee.</p>
